## Introduction
The Doctor-Patient Chatbot is designed to assist in appointments, provide basic medical information, and aid in inquiries about symptoms, medications, and more. Some questions are asked to the patient in the first conversation, the answers are then summarized and provided to a doctor. The chatbot predicts the condition, and priority is assigned to the patient based on the predicted disease. A summary of the conversation containing the patient's symptoms is provided to the doctor. The patient can also ask more questions about the predicted disease to the chatbot.
